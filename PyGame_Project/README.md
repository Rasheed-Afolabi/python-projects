# 🕹️ PyGame Project – Alien Invasion

Welcome to **Alien Invasion**, a Python-based arcade-style game developed using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library. This project is part of my learning journey through *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes and serves as a hands-on application of object-oriented programming, game loops, collision detection, and more.

## 🚀 Game Overview

**Alien Invasion** is a classic space shooter game where:

- You control a ship that can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen.
- You can shoot bullets to destroy descending alien fleets.
- The game tracks your score, level, and remaining lives.
- You level up as you destroy more aliens, increasing the difficulty.
- The game ends when all lives (ships) are lost.
